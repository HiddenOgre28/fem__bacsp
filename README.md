## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process
First, I modified the index.html file and gave the text inside it the structure of the landing page. Then, I styled it in CSS by using Sass and looking at the designs provided by Frontend Mentor in the design folder. Finally, I added a script file, picked the form and input nodes, and added event listeners to them to check the validity of the email inputed by the user before submiting the form.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

### What I learned
While styling and researching for this challenge, I learned about:

- To make a grid layout.
- To validate a form with JavaScript.

### Continued development

I will be doing my next frontend projects solely in React to learn it properly.
